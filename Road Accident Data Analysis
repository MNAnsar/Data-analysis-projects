Road Accident Analysis

Project Description:
This project involved the analysis of road accident data from the years 2021 to 2023. The dataset contains information about casualties caused by different types of vehicles. The analysis was performed using a combination of Python with Pandas for data manipulation and Excel for data cleaning.

Key Project Steps:

1. Data Collection: The dataset was collected, presumably from a reliable source, and it contains information on road accidents and casualties.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handling Missing Values: Null values in the dataset were addressed. Missing data can lead to inaccuracies in the analysis, so this step is crucial.
   - Data Format Standardization: Ensured that data types and formats are consistent, making it easier to work with the data.

3. Data Analysis:
   - Casualty Trends: The project likely involved analyzing the trends in the number of casualties over the years 2021 to 2023. This analysis can help identify any patterns or changes in road safety.
   - Type of Vehicle Analysis: The data was likely analyzed to understand the types of vehicles responsible for accidents and casualties. This analysis could provide insights into vehicle safety concerns.

4. Tools Used:
   - Python with Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - Excel: For data cleaning and further analysis.

5. Findings:
   - The analysis may have revealed trends and patterns in road accidents over the three-year period.
   - Insights into which types of vehicles are more commonly involved in accidents and the associated casualties.

6. Recommendations:
   - Based on the findings, recommendations may be provided for road safety improvements, law enforcement, or public awareness campaigns.

7. Project Conclusion:
   - The project provides valuable insights into road safety based on real accident data from 2021 to 2023.
   - The data analysis, cleaning, and presentation of findings were performed using a combination of Python and Excel.
   - what caused the accident condition of the road etc.
