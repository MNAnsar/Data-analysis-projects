Hi this is vrinda store data analysis completely performed in MS Excel.

In this comprehensive data analysis project, I have delved into various aspects of sales and orders to extract meaningful insights. I compared sales and orders in a single chart, allowing for a quick and insightful view of the data. Through meticulous data cleaning and analysis, I identified the month with the highest sales and orders, enabling us to pinpoint peak performance periods. 

Additionally, I examined the purchasing trends between genders in 2022, shedding light on whether men or women were the primary customers. I also explored the different order statuses that characterized the year 2022, providing a clear understanding of order processing. 

I took a closer look at geographical influences, listing the top 10 states contributing significantly to our sales figures. Furthermore, I examined the intriguing relationship between age and gender concerning the number of orders placed. 

To identify our most successful sales channel, I performed a detailed analysis, determining which channel contributed the most to our sales revenue. 

Last but not least, I found the highest-selling category, uncovering the cornerstone of our sales achievements. This project reflects my commitment to data cleaning and thorough analysis to derive actionable insights that can drive business decisions effectively.
